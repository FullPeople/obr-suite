## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-28

First public release. Renamed from "枭熊插件 / Owl Suite" (working title) to **Full Suite**.

### Modules

- **Dice** — top-left action popover panel. Expression parser supporting `adv`, `dis`, `max`, `min`, `reset`, `burst`, `same`, `repeat`, with independent multi-segment parsing (`adv(1d6)+adv(1d4)` rolls two separate advantage rolls). Per-token quick rolls via 5etools tag click handlers. Right-click context menu: Roll / Dark Roll / Advantage / Disadvantage / Add to Tray. Dice history popover (bottom-left) with player rows, click-to-detail, and click-to-replay speech bubbles above involved tokens. Web Audio sample playback (`dice.mp3` per die, `cartoon.mp3` for the climax punch) plus synthesized SFX for the rest of the animation pipeline. Cross-iframe SFX broadcast so the action panel iframe can play sounds when the dice-effect modal can't.
- **Initiative Tracker** — top-anchored horizontal strip with combat start, turn cycling, automatic camera focus, owner-aware roll and end-turn for player-owned tokens, optional Dice+ integration with local-roll fallback.
- **Bestiary** — DM-only side panel with 5etools monster search and one-click spawn. Auto-popup monster info on token select. Right-click context menu on tokens: Bind Monster (no slug) / Replace Monster (has slug) / Unbind Monster, with bubbles HP/AC and name auto-rewritten on bind.
- **Character Cards** — xlsx upload, parsed to a web view via the bundled Chinese D&D community 悲灵 v1.0.12 template, owner-aware quick rolls on ability scores, skills, weapon attack and damage, and clickable Trait / Feat / Spell chips that fill the global search input.
- **Global Search** — top-right floating popover over the kiwee.top 5etools mirror. Hover-to-preview right pane, click-to-pin. Settings → Libraries supports adding custom data sources following the same `search/index.json` + `data/*.json` layout.
- **Time Stop** — DM right-click action that disables player canvas input and fades cinematic black bars in/out for everyone.
- **Sync Viewport** — DM-triggered camera pan that moves every player's view to a target point or selected token, with confirmation chime.
- **Portals** — left-rail tool. Drag-circle creates a scene portal; same-tag portals teleport multi-selected tokens in a hex spiral. Editing popover provides name and tag input with localStorage-backed presets. Token light metadata is snapshot, removed during the position update, and restored 1:1 afterward to bypass the Dynamic Fog extension's light-source rejection. Drag-end detection only — programmatic position changes from teleport itself are suppressed via a 700 ms `recentlyTeleported` window so the destination doesn't immediately re-trigger the portal panel.

### UI

- Cluster popover (bottom-right) with module toggles, language switch, and inline action shortcuts.
- Settings popover (centered, tabbed) for module enable/disable, data version (2014 / 2024 / all), language, sound, support links, and library management.
- Bilingual UI throughout (CN / EN), per-client localStorage preference.
- All Chinese-character UI icons replaced with vector SVG glyphs.

### Tooling and infrastructure

- Vite build with manualChunks-isolated `vendor` chunk to avoid circular ESM dep between the OBR SDK runtime and user code.
- Self-hosted at `obr.dnd.center` (Alibaba Cloud) with Let's Encrypt HTTPS and an nginx config that disables HTML caching to prevent stale references to old hashed JS chunks after redeploys.
